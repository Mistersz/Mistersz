  Interested in infosec, especially red teaming. Also like to study reverse engineering, data science,
  math and philosophy.
  
  Things on this profile are literally just for fun and to help me
  organize myself. I will be taking notes of write-ups for CTF challenges that
  i solve as well as of HackerRank solutions.
