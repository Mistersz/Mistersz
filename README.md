  ## About me:  
  
  I'm currently getting a bachelor degree in computer science.
  Interested in infosec, especially red teaming and pwning. Also like to study reverse engineering, data science,
  math and philosophy.
  
  Things on this profile are basically projects that i do for fun and solutions
  that i like to maintain in order to organize myself. I will be taking notes of write-ups for CTF challenges that
  i solve as well as HackerRank solutions to coding problems.
